## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

In the forest deep and wide,               
Where shadows dance and secrets hide,        
A creature lurks with fearsome grace,      
The Jabberwock, with toothy face.      

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

In a yellow wood, the traveler stands,      
Two winding paths stretch out like hands.    
One is bright with footprints worn,    
The other wild, by nature adorned.     


## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->


Sure! Here’s a two-verse poem inspired by "The Walrus  and the Carpenter":        

Upon the shore, with a gleam in their eyes,    
The Walrus and Carpenter hatched clever lies.    
“Come, little oysters, don’t be shy,    
Join us for feasting beneath the sky!”       

With laughter and charm, they lured them near,    
But shadows crept in as the end drew near.    
For kindness can mask a more cunning intent,    
In the tales of the sea where innocence went.      


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

In the tapestry of life, threads intertwine,    
Colors and patterns, a story divine.    
Each voice a note in a symphony's song,    
Where struggles and triumphs in unity belong.   

She walks a path where the shadows meet,   
A dance of identities beneath her feet.   
Her skin tells a tale, her heart bears the weight,   
Of cultures and histories that shape her fate.   

A man stands beside her, his journey unique,   
With layers of strength in the silence he seeks.   
Together they rise, though the world may divide,   
Embracing the nuances they cannot hide.   

For justice is woven in the fabric we share,   
In every connection, a promise laid bare.   
Through love and through pain, our stories align,   
In the power of many, our spirits combine and aligned.
